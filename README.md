Minimal static FAQ page built with plain HTML and Tailwind (via CDN).

I have hosted this site on GitHub Pages. You can find the link in the repository.

## Features

- Simple, responsive FAQ layout
- Tailwind CSS included from CDN (`@tailwindcss/browser`)

## Files

- [index.html](index.html) — main markup and layout
- [package.json](package.json) — project metadata and scripts
- [README.md](README.md) — this file

You can inspect the test script at [`package.json.scripts.test`](package.json).

## Run / Develop

No build step required. To view locally:

1. Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser.
2. (Optional) Use a live-reload extension such as Live Server in VS Code for faster iteration.

To run the (placeholder) test script:

```sh
npm run test
```
